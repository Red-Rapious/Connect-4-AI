# Connect-4-AI
An artificial intelligence to perfectly solve the game of Connect Four.

## About
My goal is to create a perfect Connect Four bot, capable of predicting the outcome of a game in a reasonable computing time. 

## Results
I am using [Pascal Pons's test sets](http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/02-test-protocol/) for Connect 4 AIs to benchmark my different solvers.

### Min-Max (using Negamax)

| Test Set | Accuracy | Execution time (mean) | Explored positions (mean) |
| -------- | -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| L3 R1 | 100%Â | 32.7ms | 11 024 |

## Workspace description
- [`game-board`](libs/game-board/) defines some basic traits: the `Position` trait, which represents a Connect 4 grid, and the `Solver` trait, that can play the game.
  - `GridPosition` is a naive implementation of `Position` using a bi-dimensionnal vector
- [`benchmark`](libs/benchmark/) is responsible for loading test sets and to execute the tests on a given `Solver`.
- [`min-max-solver`](libs/min-max-solver/) is the first solver that I implemented, using the Negamax variant of the Min-Max algorithm.


## Running
You can check that everything is working by running:
```console
$ cargo test
```
This will execute unit tests for each component of the workspace.

To launch the main program, run:
```console
$ cargo run
```
