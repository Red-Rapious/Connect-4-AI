# Connect-4-AI
An artificial intelligence to perfectly solve the game of Connect Four.

## About
My goal is to create a perfect Connect Four bot, capable of predicting the outcome of a game in a reasonable computing time. 


## Results

## Workspace description
- [`game-board`](libs/game-board/) defines some basic traits: the `Position` trait, which represents a Connect 4 grid, and the `Solver` trait, that can play the game.
  - `GridPosition` is a naive implementation of `Position` using a bi-dimensionnal vector
  - `StackPosition` is a similar implementation, using a list-based approach instead of an array-based one. Performances are extremely close.
  - `BitboardPosition` is an optimised implementation using two `u64` to represent the board, and bitwise operations to speed up the needed functions. Performances are around 10 times faster than with the naive `GridPosition`.
- [`benchmark`](libs/benchmark/) is responsible for loading test sets and to execute the tests on a given `Solver`.
- [`min-max-solver`](libs/min-max-solver/) is the first solver that I implemented, using the Negamax variant of the Min-Max algorithm.
- [`alpha-beta-solver`](libs/alpha-beta-solver/) contains all variants of the Alpha-Beta algorithm. The different solvers are:
  - [Default](libs/alpha-beta-solver/src/alpha_beta_solver.rs): vanilla Alpha-Beta.
  - [Transposition table](libs/alpha-beta-solver/src/alpha_beta_with_transposition_table.rs): uses a Transposition table to save previously explored positions. Increases both memory usage but decreases execution time.
  - [Iterative deepening](libs/alpha-beta-solver/src/alpha_beta_with_iterative_deepening.rs): uses a dichotomic approach to progressively increase the depth of search. The possible range for the score is narrowed using the Null Window Search method.
  - [Loosing moves anticipation](libs/alpha-beta-solver/src/anticipating_alpha_beta.rs): uses optimized alignement checking from the Bitboard to efficiently predict short-term winning outcome. If the opponent has a winning move, we are forced to play against it. This allows to considerably reduce the search tree.
  - [Score-based move ordering](libs/alpha-beta-solver/src/alpha_beta_with_ordering.rs): each move is given a score using population count. The moves are then sorted using insertion sort, and recursively computed by decreasing score, to reduce the number of explored positions.


## Running
### Playing against the AI *(WIP)*
You can try to play against the AI by running the following command:
```console
$ cargo run game
```
A basic CLI game will then appear, and you will be able to select your moves by entering the column number.

### Tests
You can check that everything is working by running:
```console
$ cargo test
```
This will execute unit tests for each component of the workspace.

### Benchmark
The benchmark program can be executed using:
```console
$ cargo run [args]
```
where `[args]` is the list of the arguments needed for the benchmark. 

The list of arguments goes as follows:
```console
$ cargo run benchmark [solver] [weak] [position] [move_ordering] [L] [R]
```
With:
- `solver`: the solver type. Choose between `min_max`, `alpha_beta`, `alpha_beta_with_transposition`, `alpha_beta_with_iterative_deepening`,  `anticipating_alpha_beta`, and `alpha_beta_with_ordering`.
- `weak`: compute the numbers of move until the end (strong) or only the winner (weak). Choose between `strong` and `weak`.
- `position`: the representation of the board. Choose between `grid`, `stack` and `bitboard`.
- `move_ordering`: the order of the moves. Impactful only for Alpha-Beta-based solvers. Choose between `left_to_right`, and `center_first`.
- `L`: the overall state of the game in the test dataset. Choose between 1, 2 and 3, where 3 is the easiest.
- `R`: the overall difficulty of the game in the test dataset. Choose between 1, 2 and 3, where 3 is the easiest. Some ratings aren't available depending on `L`.

For instance:
```console
$ cargo run benchmark alpha_beta_with_transposition weak bitboard center_first 3 1
```
launches a benchmark of the Alpha-Beta solver that uses a transposition table, in Weak mode. Positions will be represented with a Bitboard, and moves will be explored starting from the center columns. The benchmark will execute the dataset `L3 R1`.
